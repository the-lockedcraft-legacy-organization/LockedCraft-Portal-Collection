# LockedCraft-Portal-Collection
A collection of .gate files from LockedCraft's implementation of Stargate-Bukkit.
Before the flattening, LC used block 43 (doubleslab) for its portals; this repo is a post-flattening patch for that.

# Description
A collection of .gate files for the LockedCraft Legacy Organisation's #LCReunion implementation of Stargate-Bukkit.

This is a collection of .gate files created by mc-smp.com for their upcoming reunion event. 
It is a quick implementation of the system originally used by lockedcraft.com

This collection has not been documented, although it is explained within [this schematic](documentation.schem).



## Background
- Before the flattening, LC used block 43 for its portals -- this gave customization options to players.
- The flattening split block 43 into numerous variants, and with the way stargate is currently configured, necessitated numerous .gate files.
- That has been accomplished with a script, and this is the result.

# Changes
#### [Version 2.1] LCLO Fork
- Updated library to 1.16
- Added a .schem file to act as temporary documentation
#### [Version 2.0] LCLO Fork
- Imported all existing portal designs
- Made a separate .gate file for all variants.
